 * Load a conversation's stored messages as `UIMessage[]` and re-validate them

 * This mirrors the POST `/api/chat` load path (`chat/route.ts`): rows are
 * ordered oldest-first, their persisted parts are cast back to UIMessage
 * parts, and `validateUIMessages` guards against rows written by an older
 * schema. This is the Phase 3 persistence/load wiring — the agent loop that
 * consumes the result is Phase 4, but the load-and-validate path is exercised
 * on every inbound persist now.
